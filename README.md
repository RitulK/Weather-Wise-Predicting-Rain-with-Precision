## Project Overview

This project explores various classification algorithms including:

- Linear Regression
  
- KNN
  
- Decision Trees
  
- Logistic Regression
  
- SVM

The models are evaluated on metrics such as:

- Accuracy Score

- Jaccard Index

- F1-Score
  
- LogLoss

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- R2-Score

The goal is to predict the `RainTomorrow` label using the Australian weather dataset.

## Dataset Information

The dataset is sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and includes daily weather observations from 2008 to 2017. The key features include:

- Temperature
  
- Rainfall
  
- Humidity
  
- Wind Speed and Direction
  
- Cloud Cover

Target Variable: `RainTomorrow` (binary: Yes/No)
